# @plathrop 2017.04.14: For API backwards-compatibility we import

# module-level constants that were present in previous versions. These
# are deprecated and should be removed in a future version.
#
# Since these are intended, we supress flake8 checks via the noqa
# tags; F401 is the unused import check.
